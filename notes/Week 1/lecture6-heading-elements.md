semantic html element - Implies some meaning to the content.

This is important because humans and/or machines can understand meaning of content surrounded by a semantic element better.

## Headings

`<h1>` is the most important heading
`<h6>` is the least important heading

By default, more important headings are displayed in larger font size, but in CSS these sizes can (and should) be customized.

## Header Elements
`header` - Company logo, other info, etc
`nav` - Contains navigation information
`section` - grouping of articles
`article` - contains the main content
`aside` - Information that is related to the content of the page but not the main content
`footer` - Footer information, contact, other links etc.

All of these are effectively equivalent to div tags, but it is important to use these semantic elements because it is easier to organize and see the structure of the page.

## Summary
* Well-chose H1 content is crucial to SEO
* Semantic elements allow for a more meaningful expression or the structure of the page.
