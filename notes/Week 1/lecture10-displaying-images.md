# Lecture 10: Displaying Images

Example: `<img src="picture-with-quote.jpg" width="400" height="500">`

Display images with the `<img>` tag. The source is where the image is - it can be a local or external link just like a hyperlink.

The width and height are not required but they are very important. If you don't specify it, the page might jump around while the images load - specifying width/height lets the browser reserve space for these images. Also, if the URL is broken and the image doesn't load, it could affect the layout of the page.

Comment:

`<!-- Hello this is a comment -->`

Result (haha):

<!-- Hello this is a comment -->

# Summary
* Remember to always specify width and height of images so that it doesn't break your layout.
