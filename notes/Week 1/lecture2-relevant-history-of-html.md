# Lecture 2: Relevant History of HTML

## How we got to HTML5

* Before 1997 there were no standards - every website and browser used and implemented different tags, formats, etc.
* In 1997 HTML 4.0 (and later 4.1) was created, first real standardized version but still a loose standard
* In 2000 XHTML 1.0 was released by W3C, much more strict than HTML 4 but many browser vendors still weren't happy.
* In 2004 browser vendors collaborated on WHATWG: HTML, some parts did not align with W3C.
* In 2007 W3C and WHATWG finally started working together, eventually released HTML5 in 2011 and onward.

## Important takeaways:

* Both W3C and WHATWG work together to make web standards.
* W3C is in charge of the HTML5 standard.
* WHATWG creates new HTML features, always evolving, some of these features are picked up by W3C and incorporated into HTML5 official standard.

## Resources:
* www.w3.org/TR/html5 - Official source of HTML5 standard.
* www.caniuse.com - Tells you which browsers support which features.
* www.validate.w3.org - Validate HTML to see if it is supported.
* Browser usage stats: There are too many browsers to check if your website is supported for all of them - it's important to know which browsers are popular to optimize for those.
